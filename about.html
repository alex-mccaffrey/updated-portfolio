            <h2>History</h2>
                <p>I am a Massachusettes native that transplanted to Colorado in 2009 to start my college career. 
                    After completing my degree in Natural Resoruce Tourism at Colorado State University, 
                    I began my journey with the Vail Ski Patrol.</p>
                <p>During my time on Patrol, I learned the importance of working as a cohesive unit at all times, 
                    and adapting to sudden changes and plans. I have adapted this skill into all aspects of my life, 
                    and web development is no different.</p>
                <p>I tend to suceed through sheer grit and determination to be the best that I can. If you have a passion 
                    for the outdoors, helping others, or exploring unchartered territory, I would love to work with you.</p>

                <h3>Ski Industry</h3>
                    <p>As ski resorts adapt to these unique times, they are faced with new restraints, requirements, and unknowns. 
                        New technologies are immergeing, and will continue to immerge, to allow these resorts to operate at maximum 
                        relative efficiency, while providing guests an experince that is seemingly unchanged.</p>

                <h3>Search and Rescue</h3>
                    <p>Search and Rescue organizations across the country live in the unkown. On top of that, a majority operate on 
                        a volunteer basis, relying on the goodwill of other for manpower, and donations for essential equipment. Well 
                        thought-out technology can not only save SAR organizations time and money, but could possibly save lives.</p>

                <h3>Avalanche Safety</h3>
                    <p>Snow safety is a not just a big product industry, it is a moral responsibility. It is important to promote, teach, 
                        learn, and practice snow safety and responsibility. Creating applications, web resources, and other technology that 
                        is easily accessible, easy to navigate, and easy to obtain, can leave to a greater knowledge base and overall safety 
                        in the backcountry.</p>
