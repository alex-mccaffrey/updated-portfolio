            <h3>National Park API</h3>
            <p>For this project, I made a call to the National Park API to display a list of relevant parks for the user.
                The user has the ability to search within the state of their choosing, as well as the max number of results.
                Given the state and max results, a call is made to the API to display the park name, description, and url
                for each park.
            </p>

            <h3>Random Dog Pic Generator</h3>
            <p>In this project, I created an image generator that displays one image for a dog breed of your choosing.
                It makes a call to the dog api and returns one image of the breed entered inthe search box.
                If no breed is found, an alert will notify the user.

            <h3>Vail Quiz App</h3>
            <p>I created an quiz application that provides multiple choice questions, and provides real-time feedback to
                the user based on the answer selected. This is done with a very basic html foundation, and utilizes
                javascript to display the pages dynamically.

            <h3>API Capstone Project</h3>
            <p>This project is a culmination of skills learned in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and API's.
                I decided to go with hiking trails, as I love the outdoors and use other hiking apps frequently.
                This app allows the user to input a location and filter the results, and in return, they get a list of
                hiking trails and weather for the requested location. In addition, the user can click on a trail and get a
                marker
                on the interactive map for the exact location.
